    "text": "🐌 Characterising transgenerational plasticity  PhD project\nSome people say that you will eventually circle back to your PhD project at some point of your career, though I think it’s unlikely since I’m glad it’s behind me! This is probably because I had always wanted to work on fish behaviour and evolution, which I did end up doing for my PhD project. That said, I had two great supervisors – Émilien Luquet and Sandrine Plénet – with whom I always enjoy interacting, as I do with everyone in the LEHNA team.\nI began my PhD project at Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University (France) with a 3-month internship in 2015 and officially started in September 2017. I completed it in April 2021. During this time, I conducted two lab experiments on tiny, cute freshwater snails over multiple generations, analysed three datasets from previous experiments, and wrote a literature review (PDF)!\nThe lab experiments followed a similar a similar design: We were exposing snails to predator odours and then measuring the resulting effects on their shell morphology and behaviour, along with transgenerational effects on their offspring. We repeated this experiment to identify factors influencing the presence, magnitude and direction of these transgenerational effects. The factors we characterised included the generation that was exposed (PDF), the parent exposed (PDF) and the timing of exposure during development (PDF). In the background, there was the aim of understanding how different environmental effects combine to shape the expression of anti-predator defences (PDF). My PhD thesis is available for download (here), though it’s written in French!\n\n\n\n\n\nI was proud to apply my interest in and knowledge of animal personality to a project that examined whether parental exposure to predators caused snails to behave more similarly to or differently from one another (PDF). I also became involved in two side projects, both of which focused on transgenerational plasticity in Physa snails, of course! One explored the transgenerational effects at the level of gene expression (PDF); while the other investigated the maintenance of transgenerational plasticity after many lab generations, which is still waiting in Émilien’s computer.\nAs you may have noticed, four papers ended up being published in 2020, people often get confused when citing Tariel et al. 2020 – which I completely understand! 🤪"

Apart from the cameras, I built the entire experiment from bits, leftovers, and pieces I found in the gigantic university basement: it felt like a treasure hunt! I still need to publish this study – the data is sadly sitting on my computer."

    "text": "🐣 Brood parasistim in fish  Master internship\nIn Spring 2015, I had the privilege to meet and work with one of my favourite researchers, Giacomo Bernardi  at the University of California, Santa Cruz (USA). I conducted molecular biology lab work in his lab near the sea, where the weather was a perfectly sunny 20-25°C every day.\nThere are only a handful of marine fish species that care for their newborn babies (though many care for their eggs), and two Altrichthys damselfish species are one of them. These fish stay with their babies in the same spot on the reef and ferociously protect them – and you know how bold and fierce a damselfish can be! Giacomo wanted to determine whether brood parasitism occurred in these species. Since the babies look very similar to each other, even between the two Altrichthys species, we used microsatellite DNA markers to determine whether parents were caring exclusively for their own offspring or for babies from other parents as well. Long story short, there was indeed brood parasitism! You can find more information in the PDF.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo keep me busy at the end of my internship, Giacomo had me prepare samples for RAD sequencing, which resulted in two great publications."

I worked at the Endoume station of the IMBE (Institut Méditerranéen de la Biodiversité et d’Écologie marine et continentale), which is part of Aix-Marseille University. I worked one and a half months at the station under the supervision of Didier Aurelle, whom I recommend highly as a supervisor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project focused on the recolonisation abilities of gorgonian corals, either on a new shipwreck or following mortality events caused by heat waves. We assessed this using microsatellite markers (PDF)"

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nWhat is Open Science? Open science involves many initiatives and practices that aim at make scientific results reliable, available for everyone and beneficial for humanity, while opening the process of scientific creation to everyone. You can find a nice description of what is open science by the UNESCO here.↩︎\nWhat is SORTEE? SORTEE is not just a scientific society – it is an inspiring community full of motivated and knowledgeable people. I highly recommend joining, regardless of your career stage or experience with open science. As a member, you will gain access to an active Slack channel for support, information on open science initiatives and job opportunities, free events like conferences, code clubs, workshops, seminars, and networking opportunities to find collaborators.↩︎\nWhat is the Peer Community Journal? The Peer Community Journal (PCJ) is the journal of the Peer Community In (PCI) initiative. PCI seeks to address issues in the current publication system by creating communities in different fields to review and recommend preprints. This aims to free researchers from reliance on commercial publishers and promotes evaluating their work based on quality rather than metrics. Each PCI recommendation includes a short paragraph explaining the importance and quality of the publication, making it easier to assess a researcher’s work by reading these recommendations instead of looking at their h-index or citation counts.↩︎\nWhat is DEI? Diversity, Equity and Inclusion involves many initiatives and practices that aim at creating an environment where everyone feel safe, welcomed, respected and valued and get the same opportunities to participate in the scientific process.↩︎\nKeeping marine fish in aquariums is challenging, and sourcing these fish can be problematic. I wanted to avoid collecting fish from the reef or dying in the lab for my research. During my field observations, fish participated in the experiments willingly, so I didn’t need to catch them. Unfortunately, I did have to catch and sacrifice ghost crabs as part of my experiments to use them as food for fish. However, there was no waste – every crab I caught was consumed by fish. Wrasses love eating crabs!↩︎"
