    "text": "🙂 Hi there, thanks for visiting my personal website.\n🐟 I am an early-career researcher interested in evolution, marine biology, and animal behaviour. I’m fascinated by fish and marine life in general.\n👀 I’m looking for a new postdoctoral research position focused on fish behaviour and cognition, ideally working on behavioural traditions of coral reef fish. Feel free to contact me to connect.\n📍 I currently hold an honorary postdoctoral position at Macquarie University. I work on a project about fishes that use tools remotely from France. See all my current and past projects here.\n✨ I’m also involved in the scientific society SORTEE, where I serve on the board of directors, the conference committee, and the DEI committee. See my committments here towards a science that is respectful and caring to all humans and living beings."
