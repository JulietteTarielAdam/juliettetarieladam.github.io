  abstract = {Marine ecosystems are strongly impacted by the consequences of human activities, such as habitat destruction or artificialization and climate change. In the Mediterranean Sea, sessile benthic species, and particularly octocorals, have been affected by mass mortality events linked with positive thermal anomalies. The future survival of octocoral populations impacted by global change will depend on their recolonization abilities facing local extirpation or important modification of their habitat. We studied these processes in Mediterranean octocorals in two situations: the colonization of artificial substrates (wrecks) by the red gorgonian Paramuricea clavata, and the recolonization following mortality events in the yellow gorgonian Eunicella cavolini. With microsatellite markers (seven for P. clavata, five for E. cavolini), we analyzed the genetic diversity of populations on artificial substrates and their differentiation from other neighboring populations. For P. clavata the populations on artificial substrates were not or lowly differentiated from the closest populations (1.3–1.6 km) on natural substrates, and showed similar levels of genetic diversity. Artificial substrates can then be considered as an interesting substitute for natural substrates for this species. For E. cavolini we did not detect any variation in diversity or relatedness following recuperation after mortality events. In both cases, our results suggest the input from different populations in the recolonization process, which helps in maintaining the genetic diversity. These results are useful for the management of these species and of associated ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Globally, Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) continue to be sold and kept in small, barren jars or tanks, with little concern for their welfare. This study aimed to examine the impact of housing size and furnishings (i.e. live plants, refuges) on the behaviour of Siamese fighting fish, to understand optimal tank conditions. Thirteen male Siamese fighting fish were rotated between five different housing conditions: ‘jar’ (1.5 L); ‘small’ (3.3 L); ‘medium’ (5.6 L); ‘large’ (19.3~L); and ‘large-barren’ (19.3 L). All tanks had gravel and furnishings, except the large-barren tank which was devoid of these. Overall, tank size influenced behaviour. Fish were significantly more active and spent significantly less time resting and performing ‘abnormal’ behaviours (hovering and stereotypic swimming), in the large tank compared to the smaller tanks. Tank furnishings also influenced behaviour. Fishes in the large-barren tank performed more ‘abnormal’ behaviours (hovering, stereotypic swimming, interaction with the walls), compared to the large tank which had furnishings. These results suggest that the small, barren jars and tanks that Siamese fighting fish are often housed in are detrimental to their welfare, and larger, furnished tanks are more optimal. Behavioural variations were observed between the fish in this study, highlighting individual fish personality. We recommend a minimum tank size of 5.6 L for the display and sale of Siamese fighting fish, and tanks larger than this for keeping Siamese fighting fish at home. All tanks should contain gravel, live plants and refuges.},

Marine species have been a difficult challenge in that respect, due to the difficulty in assessing population sizes and the open nature of such populations. Small, isolated islands with endemic species offer an opportunity to groundtruth population size estimates with empirical data and investigate the genetic consequences of such small populations. Here we focus on two endemic species of reef fish, the Clipperton damselfish, Stegastes baldwini, and the Clipperton angelfish, Holacanthus limbaughi, on Clipperton Atoll, tropical eastern Pacific. Visual surveys, performed over almost two decades and four expeditions, and genetic surveys based on genomic RAD sequences, allowed us to estimate kinship and genetic diversity, as well as to compare population size estimates based on visual surveys with effective population sizes based on genetics. We found that genetic and visual estimates of population numbers were remarkably similar. S. baldwini and H. limbaughi had population sizes of approximately 800,000 and 60,000, respectively. Relatively small population sizes resulted in low genetic diversity and the presence of apparent kinship. This study emphasizes the importance of small isolated islands as models to study population dynamics of marine organisms.},

  abstract = {Inducible defences in response to predation risk are a well-known example of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. Although inducible defences have been studied mainly within a generation (within-generational plasticity), there is now clear evidence that ancestral exposure to predation risk can influence the defences expressed by offspring, even if they have not been exposed themselves (transgenerational plasticity). The molecular mechanisms allowing the transmission of environmental information across generations are not well understood. In this study, we combined measures of antipredator responses (behavioural and morphological) with transcriptomic investigations across two generations in the freshwater snail Physa acuta. We hypothesised that both within- and transgenerational plasticity would induce phenotypic changes associated with differential gene expression. Our results confirmed within- and transgenerational plasticity: F1 snails respond to predator-cue exposure by increasing escape behaviour, reducing shell length, and developing thicker and slenderer shells, whereas F2 snails from exposed parents have longer and thicker shells with narrower apertures. Within- and transgenerational plasticity were accompanied by the differential expression of 112 genes (101 up- and 11 downregulated) and 23 differentially expressed genes (17 up- and 6 downregulated), respectively. Within- and transgenerational plasticity did not share common differentially expressed genes, but the associated molecular functions, involving metabolism and transcription regulation, were similar. These results suggest that predator-induced within-generational plasticity and transgenerational plasticity may result from different genomic pathways and may evolve independently.},

  abstract = {Background: Within-generational plasticity (WGP) and transgenerational plasticity (TGP) are mechanisms allowing rapid adaptive responses to fluctuating environments without genetic change. These forms of plasticity have often been viewed as independent processes. Recent evidence suggests that WGP is altered by the environmental conditions experienced by previous generations (i.e., TGP). In the context of inducible defenses, one of the most studied cases of plasticity, the WGP x TGP interaction has been poorly investigated. Results: We provide evidence that TGP can alter the reaction norms of inducible defenses in a freshwater snail. The WGP x TGP interaction patterns are trait-specific and lead to decreased slope of reaction norms (behaviour and shell thickness). Offspring from induced parents showed a higher predator avoidance behaviour and a thicker shell than snails from non-induced parents in no predator-cue environment while they reached similar defenses in predator-cue environment. The WGP x TGP interaction further lead to a switch from a plastic towards a constitutive expression of defenses for shell dimensions (flat reaction norm). Conclusions: WGP-alteration by TGP may shape the adaptive responses to environmental change and then has a substantial importance to understand the evolution of plasticity.},

Environmental and biological factors can influence the breeding success of these migrations. However, there is a lack of long-term studies on benthic migratory species that analyse their response to climatic variation. Climate change may threaten the breeding migration of species that rely on environmental cues to initiate migration. Port Jackson sharks, Heterodontus portusjacksoni, display high philopatry to their breeding grounds. Using passive acoustic telemetry, this study investigated the annual migration patterns of Port Jackson sharks at a breeding aggregation site in Jervis Bay, Australia. The influence of biological (sex and size) and environmental factors (temperature, East Australian current strength, rainfall, moon phase and period of the day) on these patterns was assessed over a 7-year period (2013–2019). The results of the linear mixed-effects models revealed annual and individual variability in migration timing, with males arriving and departing earlier than females. There was no influence of environmental variables on the migration timing of Port Jackson sharks. We found that more sharks arrived and departed at night. Overall, there was significant repeatability in migration timing for both arrival and departure. This interannual individual consistency has important implications for breeding success at the population level. Migration patterns that are unresponsive to environmental cues may lead to a mismatch between migration timing and suitable conditions for juvenile survival.},

A major source of within-population heterogeneity is personality. Nonetheless, it is still relatively rarely accounted for in social learning studies that constitute the most basic process of cultural transmission. Here, we performed in female mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) a social learning experiment in the context of mate choice, a situation called mate copying (MC), and for which there is strong evidence that it can lead to the emergence of persistent traditions of preferring a given male phenotype. When accounting for the global tendency of females to prefer larger males but ignoring differences in personality, we detected no evidence for MC. However, when accounting for the bold–shy dichotomy, we found that bold females did not show any evidence for MC, while shy females showed significant amounts of MC. This illustrates how the presence of variation in personality can hamper our capacity to detect MC. We conclude that MC may be more widespread than we thought because many studies ignored the presence of within-population heterogeneities.},

Thus, we provided positive social information for small males to test whether female zebrafish changed their mate preference after observing a pair of a small and a large male with a demonstrator female next to the small one. After that, we tested the observer female in a test maze to evaluate boldness. We found no significant evidence for mate copying as females did not change their preference for the small male after witnessing the large male alone and the small male interacting with another female and chose consistently larger males in a control without opportunity to copy. Whether the female was defined as shy or bold had no effect on mate copying. We conclude that mate copying is probably inexistent or only relatively weak in this species.},

Fishes could provide insight into these factors via comparison of ecological and morphological differences between tool-using and non-tool-using species. Anvil use is one example of tool use by fish: the fish holds a hard-shelled prey item in its mouth and strikes it onto a hard surface (anvil) to open it. To date, anvil use has been described in 26 of the\,{$>$}\,550 described wrasse/Labridae species. Through a community science program called Fish Tool Use, 16 new observations of anvil use were collected in five species of a monophyletic group of wrasses called the New World Halichoeres. These new observations provide the first evidence of anvil use by Halichoeres brasiliensis, H. poeyi and H. radiatus, and the first video evidence of anvil use by H. garnoti and H. bivittatus. They extend the geographic range of known anvil use by wrasses to a new region, the western Atlantic, making this behaviour even more widespread than previously reported. Video analysis revealed that wrasses are flexible in their anvil use: They did not have a preferred side of their body, they cracked open a diverse array of prey on a variety of anvil types, and often used many anvils and striking points for the same prey item. More observations are needed to determine the evolutionary origin of anvil use behaviour, its ecological drivers, costs, and benefits.},

Species-specific barcodes revealed the existence of low levels (3.5\% of all offspring) of mixed interspecific broods, mostly juvenile Amblyglyphidodon batunai and Pomacentrus smithi damselfish in Altrichthys broods. A separate analysis of conspecific parentage based on microsatellite markers revealed that mixed parentage broods are common in both species, and the genetic patterns are consistent with two different modes of conspecific brood parasitism, although further studies are required to determine the specific mechanisms responsible for these mixed parentage broods. While many broods had offspring from multiple parasites, in many cases a given brood contained only a single foreign offspring, perhaps a consequence of the movement of lone juveniles between nests. In other cases, broods contained large numbers of putative parasitic offspring from the same parents and we propose that these are more likely to be cases where parasitic adults laid a large number of eggs in the host nest than the result of movements of large numbers of offspring from a single brood after hatching. The evidence that these genetic patterns reflect adaptive brood parasitism, as well as possible costs and benefits of parasitism to hosts and parasites, are discussed.},

We tested whether developmental and parental environments impacted personality and immediate plasticity. We raised two generations of Physa acuta snails in the laboratory with or without developmental exposure to predator cues. Escape behaviour was repeatedly assessed on adult snails with or without predator cues in the immediate environment. On average, snails were slower to escape if they or their parents had been exposed to predator cues during development. Snails were also less plastic in response to immediate predation risk on average if they or their parents had been exposed to predator cues. Group diversity in personality was greater in predator-exposed snails than unexposed snails, while parental environment did not influence it. Group diversity in immediate plasticity was not significant. Our results suggest that only developmental environment plays a key role in the emergence of group diversity in personality, but that parental environment influences mean behavioural responses to the environmental change. Consequently, although different, both developmental and parental cues may have evolutionary implications on behavioural responses.},

  abstract = {Almost all animal species are engaged in predator-prey interactions. These interactions, variable in time and space, favor the emergence and evolution of phenotypic plasticity, which allows prey to fine-tune their phenotype to the current risk of predation. A famous example is the induction of defensive neck-teeth, spines or helmets in some water fleas when they detect cues of predator presence. In general, the response may involve different types of traits (behavioral, morphological, physiological and life-history traits), alone or in combination. The induced traits may be adaptive anti-predator defenses or reflect more general stress-based responses. Recently, it has been found that predator-induced plasticity occurs not only within but also across generations (transgenerational plasticity), i.e. the phenotype of a generation is influenced by the detection of predator-cues in previous generation(s), even if the current generation is not itself exposed to these cues. In this paper, we aim to review this accumulating literature and propose a current state of key aspects of predator-induced transgenerational plasticity in metazoans. In particular, we review whether patterns of predator-induced transgenerational plasticity depend on the type of traits. We analyze the adaptive value of predator-induced transgenerational plasticity and explored the evidence for its evolution and underlying mechanisms. We also consider its temporal dynamics: What are the time windows during which predator-cues must be detected to be transmitted across generations? Are transgenerational responses in offspring stage-dependent? How many generations does transgenerational plasticity persist? Finally, we discuss other factors highlighted in the literature that influence predator-induced transgenerational plasticity: What are the relative contributions of maternal and paternal exposure to predator-cues in generating transgenerational plasticity? Do transgenerational responses depend on offspring sex? Do they scale with the perceived level of predation risk? This review shows that we are only at the beginning of understanding the processes of predator-induced transgenerational plasticity, and it encourages future research to fill the lack of knowledge highlighted here.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity can occur across generations (transgenerational plasticity) when environments experienced by the previous generations influenced offspring phenotype. The evolutionary importance of transgenerational plasticity, especially regarding within-generational plasticity, is a currently hot topic in the plasticity framework. How long an environmental effect can persist across generations and whether multigenerational effects are cumulative are primordial—for the evolutionary significance of transgenerational plasticity—but still unresolved questions. In this study, we investigated how the grand-parental, parental and offspring exposures to predation cues shape the predator-induced defences of offspring in the Physa acuta snail. We expected that the offspring phenotypes result from a three-way interaction among grand-parental, parental and offspring environments. We exposed three generations of snails without and with predator cues according to a full factorial design and measured offspring inducible defences. We found that both grand-parental and parental exposures to predator cues impacted offspring antipredator defences, but their effects were not cumulative and depended on the defences considered. We also highlighted that the grand-parental environment did alter reaction norms of offspring shell thickness, demonstrating an interaction between the grand-parental transgenerational plasticity and the within-generational plasticity. We concluded that the effects of multigenerational exposure to predator cues resulted on complex offspring phenotypic patterns which are difficult to relate to adaptive antipredator advantages.},

  abstract = {Transgenerational plasticity, which occurs when the environment experienced by parents changes the phenotype of offspring, is widespread in animal and plant species. Both maternal and paternal environments can underlie transgenerational plasticity, but experimental studies unraveling how their effects interact together and with the personal (both developmental and immediate) environments are still rare. Yet unraveling these interactions is fundamental to understanding how offspring integrate past and present environmental cues to produce adaptive phenotype. Using the hermaphroditic and freshwater snail Physa acuta, we tested how predator cues experienced by offspring, mothers and fathers interact to shape offspring anti-predator behavior. We raised a first generation of snails in the laboratory with or without chemical predator cues and realized full-factorial crosses to disentangle maternal and paternal cues. We then raised the second generation of snails with or without predator cues and assessed, when adults, their escape behavior in two immediate environments (with or without predator cues) and activity in the immediate environment without predator cues. We found that personal, maternal, and paternal predator cues interacted to shape offspring escape behavior and activity. Firstly, for escape behavior, snails integrated the cues from developmental and parental environments only when exposed to predator cues in their immediate environment, suggesting that personal immediate experience must corroborate the risky parental environment to reveal transgenerational plasticity. For activity, this same hypothesis helps explain why no clear pattern of transgenerational plasticity was revealed, as activity was only measured without predator cues in the immediate environment. Secondly, a single maternal exposure to predator cues decreased offspring escape behavior while a single paternal exposure had no effect, surprisingly demonstrating sex-specific transgenerational plasticity for a simultaneous hermaphroditic species. Thirdly, when both mother and father were exposed, paternal cues were integrated by offspring according to their own developmental environment. The paternal exposure then mitigated the reduction in escape behavior due to the maternal exposure only when offspring developed in control condition. Overall, our study highlighted complex patterns of sex-specific transgenerational plasticity resulting from nonadditive interactions between parental, developmental and immediate experiences.},
