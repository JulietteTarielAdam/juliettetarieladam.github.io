🙂 Hi there, thanks for visiting my personal website.

🐟 I am an early-career researcher interested in how fish and other marine organisms evolve and behave. 

👀 I am looking for a new postdoctoral position focused on fish behaviour and cognition, ideally working on behavioural traditions of coral reef fish. Feel free to contact me to connect.

📍 I currently hold an honorary postdoctoral position at Macquarie University. I work on a [project about fishes that use tools](https://fishtooluse.com){target="_blank"} remotely from France. You can find all my [ongoing and past projects here](projects.qmd).

✨ I'm also involved in the scientific society [SORTEE](https://sortee.org){target="_blank"}, where I serve on the Board of Directors, the Conference Committee, and the DEI Committee. See [my commitments here](commitments.qmd) towards a science that is respectful and caring to all humans and living beings.
